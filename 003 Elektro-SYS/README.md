__A 15 minutes introduction to *Mechanism Design*__  
__Speaker:__ Jonas K. Sekamane, EER  
__Abstract:__ Economics mainly deal with the question of how people, firms and other types of agents act within a given environment. In contrast, the subfield known as *Mechanism Design* asks; What kind of environment should a "designer" create if this "designer" wants to achieve a certain objective? And furthermore which objectives can realistically be achieved? Put differently, if agents have private information (such as costs, preferences, valuations, etc.), then which game do you have to let the agents play to get the outcome that you want. This short presentation will go through some of the classic results in mechanism design, and hopefully bring about an interesting discussion on *the design of electricity markets*.
